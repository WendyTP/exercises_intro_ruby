# exercise10- use a for loop to print each name in a given array

friends =["Sarah", "John", "Hanna", "Dave"]

for friend in friends
  puts "Hello, #{friend}!"
end

#(when naming variables in a for loop, it's good to use standard format
# for friend in friends, for cat in cats, etc. This makes it clear
# what we are iterating over.)
