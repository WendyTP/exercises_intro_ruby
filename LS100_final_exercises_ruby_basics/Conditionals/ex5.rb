# exercise 5

number = 7

if number
  puts "My favorite number is #{number}."
else
  puts "I don't have a favorite number."
end

=begin
The above code will print 7. if + true value or truth will evaluate to true.
since number contains a truthy value, the statement for if will then be excuted.

(every expression evaluates to true when used in a conditon, except false and nil)
=end
